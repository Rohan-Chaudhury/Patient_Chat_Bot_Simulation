I've been pastoring the church for the last 25 years and I have built up a nice congregation. My wife's at home with Alzheimer's. I feel very guilty these days because I've been drinking pretty heavily and I don't want to disappoint people. But it’s the only way I’ve been able to cope lately. It's not an easy situation with my wife. My wife has good days and bad days. And on the bad days regarding my wife, I get affected the most. You know my son helps a lot around the house but he is working on his PhD and he doesn’t have time to help me out that much. It's just very painful to watch my wife deteriorate and the drinking helps me cope. Drinking calms me down, helps me sleep, and makes it easier for me to communicate with people. I know it's not healthy for me but drinking is the most cost-efficient way for me to calm down these days. I am using alcohol as a coping mechanism and I am not proud of it. The disadvantages of drinking are as follows: one thing is what happened to my throat, I could also lose face with those who have placed a lot of trust in me, and overall, it is detrimental to my health. I drink about two or three beers a night with a couple of shots. Yes, I would like to discuss a solution together with you. Drinking only beer might be a good way of trying to wean me off the heavy stuff. I have not looked for any Alzheimer’s support group yet but I think that's a good idea. I know I can join Alcohol and Anonymous. Sometimes my wife's situation could be beneficial to this. Before when I have tried to cut back I've been successful sometimes. I can cut back to two or three beers a day but then something will always come up to trigger it again. You know something will happen at church, I have a problem with trying to communicate with my wife or something in the family. The following things helped me in trying to cut back: when I focus on trying to exercise more and when I meet with friends. But I don't have a lot of time to do that with my current situation. That’s why I could never get any consistent with any of that. My willingness to cut down on drinking is at least an eight out of 10. My confidence level in succeeding to quit drinking would be around six or seven. It’s because I haven’t been successful in maintaining it in the past. Back in the day, I used to swim every day. This form of exercise was very relaxing for me. But I can't take advantage of it. You know with my current situation if I could just find some way to do it regularly, I think it will help. I am perfectly okay with talking more about my condition the next time we meet. Thank you so much for meeting with me, have a great day.\"\"\"\n",
