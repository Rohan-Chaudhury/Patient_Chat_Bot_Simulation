Progress: Made a bigger dataset with 71 intents and responses, 60 lines of context for personality of Pastor Zimmerman, 70 manual responses
Wrote a python script for the final bot, models used: deepset/roberta-base-squad2 and sentence-transformers/paraphrase-xlm-r-multilingual-v1
Model uses both context recognition and intent-based matching
